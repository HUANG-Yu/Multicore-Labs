# Multicore-Labs
Three Labs of Multicore - TSL, Primes, Sudoku

Lab1: Using Pthread to implement travelling salesman problem, generating all the permutations then equally divides the task to each threads.

Lab2: Using OpenMP to implemnet Sieve Algorithm, parallel for is used in the outer loop.

Lab3: Using OpenMP and MPI to implement Sudoku separately.
